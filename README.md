# Wordle-Bot

Do you like doing the wordle? 
Well, I sure don't

I noticed a lot of other people like wordle, and build up these huge, crazy wordle streaks. Wouldn't it be nice to not only know todays answer, but also predict the future?

I made this as a solo project in python about a year back, to try and learn about web requests in python. 
This project was almost entirely created by me, except I was having an error with the exporting so I used chatgpt to add in some debugging
